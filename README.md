## Background ##  Sex is a significant factor in respiratory disease epidemiology. However, how men and women differ in their responses to indoor airborne bacterial exposure remains unclear.

## Objective ## To investigate the association between indoor airborne bacterial exposure and lung function and airway inflammation in adults, with a focus on sex-specific differences.

Methods: In this cross-sectional study, airborne dust samples were collected from the bedrooms of 1,038 adult participants (463 men and 575 women) across five Nordic cities participating in the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS) III. Bacterial communities were characterized using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Bacterial load and endotoxin levels were quantified by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and the Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay, respectively. Multivariate linear regression models, stratified by sex, were used to assess associations between bacterial exposures, lung function, and airway inflammation.

Results: Higher indoor bacterial diversity was significantly associated with better lung function in men (FEV1 β = 0.17, 95% CI: 0.05 to 0.29, p = 0.003) and with higher FeNO levels in women (β = 2.44, 95% CI: 0.73 to 4.15, p = 0.005). Increased endotoxin load was also associated with elevated FeNO levels in women (β = 0.37, 95% CI: 0.05 to 0.70, p = 0.02), but not in men. Genera from the Actinobacteriota and Bacilli classes were generally associated with better lung function, whereas Clostridia genera were linked to lower lung function and reduced airway inflammation. In contrast, several genera within Actinobacteriota and Gammaproteobacteria were positively associated with higher FeNO levels, suggesting a potential contribution to airway inflammation.

Conclusions: Indoor airborne bacterial exposures were associated with respiratory health in a sex-specific manner. These findings highlight the importance of microbial diversity and composition in shaping adult lung function and airway inflammation and underscore the need for sex-specific approaches in future research and prevention strategies.
